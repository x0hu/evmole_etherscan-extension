# Evmole for Etherscan

A Chrome extension that enhances Etherscan by displaying function selectors for Ethereum smart contracts. Primarily for unverified contracts, but can also be used for verified contracts.

## Features

- Automatically detects contract pages on Etherscan
- Displays function selectors in a clean, floating panel
- Shows function signatures and their corresponding 4-byte selectors
- Easy to use with a non-intrusive interface
- Purposely does not highlight erc20 functions
